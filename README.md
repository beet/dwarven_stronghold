# Dwarven Stronghold

Todo:

- [ ] Implement the non-map view
- [ ] Monsters!
- [ ] Random map
- [ ] Bigger map

## Version 3

This version is effectively a full implementation of the game from the book in Ruby, with a few modifications:

* The player and treasure are both placed in the map randomly
* The map is always visible, and does not incure a movement penalty
