## Version 4

This is the original game design which just shows "North: open" etc. by
default, with the option to view the map.

It's actually really challenging!

Might be fun to revert it back to map view by default and add monsters.

## Version 3

This version is effectively a full implementation of the game from the book in Ruby, with a few modifications:

* The player and treasure are both placed in the map randomly
* The map is always visible, and does not incure a movement penalty
